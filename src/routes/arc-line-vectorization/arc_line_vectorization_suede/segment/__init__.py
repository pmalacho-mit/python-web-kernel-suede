"""Split a skeleton into segments at branch points and visualize them.

A "segment" is a maximal run of degree-2 skeleton pixels bounded by node
pixels at each end. A node pixel is one of:
  - an endpoint: a skeleton pixel with exactly one 8-connected skeleton
    neighbour (degree 1).
  - a branch: a skeleton pixel with three or more 8-connected skeleton
    neighbours (degree >= 3). Adjacent branch pixels are merged into a
    single super-junction so that thick junctions in the skeleton don't
    spawn spurious tiny segments.

``segment_skeleton`` is a thin wrapper around ``trace_skeleton`` that also
applies an optional minimum-length filter. ``visualize_segments`` produces
a PNG where each segment is drawn in a distinct colour using golden-ratio
hue spacing so adjacent segments are easy to tell apart visually.

The ``Segment`` class runs the full pipeline:

    skeleton + binary

       v
    [trace]          self.segments
       |
       v
    [fuse 1st pass]  self.fused        (with self.accepted, self.all)
       |             A* through binary; bridges noisy junctions.
       v
    [repair]         self.repaired
       |             Per-junction LS solve, replaces noisy regions.
       v
    [resolve         self.cleaned      (with self.collapsed_chromosomes)
     chromosomes]    Collapses skeletonization "centromere" artifacts
       |             where two strokes overlapped along a length.
       v
    [fuse 2nd pass]  self.joined       (with self.joined_accepted)
                     Pairwise tangent matching at clean junctions;
                     no path-finding, just cluster-and-match.
