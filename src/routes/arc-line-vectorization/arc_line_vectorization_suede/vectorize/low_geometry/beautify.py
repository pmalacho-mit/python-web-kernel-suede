"""Beautification pass: detect candidate soft constraints.

After the first solve, scan all primitives for near-relationships and
add them as constraints so the second solve snaps them exact (or close
to it). The four relationships we look for:

* **Parallel.** Two lines whose direction angle differs by < ``parallel_tol`` rad.
* **Perpendicular.** Two lines whose directions differ by < ``perp_tol`` rad from 90°.
* **Equal radius.** Two arcs/circles whose radii differ by less than
  ``radius_tol`` fractionally.
* **Concentric.** Two arcs/circles whose centers are within
  ``center_tol`` absolute pixels.

Tolerances should be calibrated to the upstream noise of hand-drawn
strokes: roughly the natural mode of the residual histogram. Defaults
are starting points; tune on real input.

    Two common forms appear in real data:

    1. **Chained halves.** Arc A runs from p0 to p1, arc B runs from
       p1' ≈ p1 back to p0' ≈ p0, going the other way around. The two
       chain end-to-end.
    2. **Parallel halves.** Both arcs share start and end endpoints,
       and bulge in opposite directions. This happens when upstream
       segmentation produces TWO polylines tracing the same loop in
       opposite directions (e.g. the bird's head outline in birdlove
       gets split into upper and lower halves, each starting at the
       chord endpoint nearest the beak and ending at the chord
       endpoint nearest the body).

    Either way, the criteria are:
      * radii within ``radius_tol_rel`` fractionally
      * centers within ``center_tol_rel * mean_radius`` (loose because
        each half-fit pulled its center toward its own data)
      * endpoints connect (one of the two patterns above)
      * combined sweep ≥ ``full_circle_sweep_thresh_deg``

    If all hold, the pair is replaced with a single Circle at the
    chord midpoint (which is closer to the true center than either
    individual fit when the two fits split the difference).
