"""Local junction repair for skeleton-derived polylines.

After ``fuse_segments``, polylines still pass through (or terminate at)
skeleton-level junctions. The handful of pixels nearest a Y, T, or X
junction is typically distorted: skeletonization commits each pixel to
exactly one stroke, so at a crossing it has to make local compromises
that look like small jogs, multi-pixel-thick "horizontal blobs", or
kinks in the polyline path. These don't match the actual stroke
geometry on either side of the junction, and they later confuse the
line/arc fitter.

The fix: trust each segment's behaviour OUTSIDE the junction (its
tangent in the stable region a few pixels away), not the distorted
local geometry. For every junction, solve for the single 2D point
that all stable approaches meet at (a 2x2 least-squares problem), then
replace each polyline's junction-affected indices with that single
point. Polylines that pass through a junction now do so without the
jog; polylines that terminate at one now end at the same shared point
as their neighbours.

Junction validity and region extent are decided GEOMETRICALLY, from
the polyline's smoothed second-derivative magnitude |r''|:

  (a) A cluster of close points across polylines is only treated as a
      real junction if at least one polyline has a |r''| spike in a
      padded window around the cluster. A spike means the polyline
      bends sharply somewhere near the cluster -- exactly what the
      skeletonizer's local "decide where to put pixels" compromises
      produce at a real X/Y/T crossing. Two smooth polylines that just
      happen to run within tol of each other (parallel coincidence,
      tangent kiss) have no such spike and are correctly skipped.
      Searching a few pixels OUTSIDE the strict cluster matters for
      terminating-polyline junctions: there the cluster captures only
      the polyline's first or last few points, and the actual kink
      sits 1-5 pixels in from the endpoint.

  (b) For each polyline in a real junction, the region replaced by
      the junction point is grown outward from the strict spatial
      cluster while |r''| stays elevated above the polyline's local
      baseline. Without this extension, skeleton noise that spills a
      few pixels past the close-points zone survives into the output
      as a small "shelf" or jog next to the cleaned junction.

  (c) Tangents for the LS solve are taken from samples just OUTSIDE
      the extended region, so the meeting point is constrained by
      genuinely smooth polyline geometry rather than by pixels that
      are still inside the noisy region.

Algorithm:

1. Build a junction graph over polyline points. Two points are linked
   if they lie within ``junction_tol`` of each other AND belong to
   different polylines. Connected components are junction clusters.

2. For each cluster spanning >= 2 polylines:
     - Reject if any polyline contributes more than
       ``max_junction_region_length`` consecutive points to the
       cluster (a sanity net against pathologically long runs --
       typically closed-loop polylines whose start and end coincide).
     - Reject unless at least one polyline shows a |r''| spike in a
       padded window around its cluster indices (the kink test).
     - Extend each polyline's region by walking outward through
       elevated-|r''| pixels.
     - Build approaches from samples beyond each extended region.
     - Reject if the approach tangents are all nearly parallel
       (tangent kiss).
     - Solve the 2x2 LS problem for the junction point.

3. For each polyline involved in the junction, splice out the
   junction-affected indices (extended) and replace them with the
   single junction point. Adjacent emitted segments are bridged with
   1-pixel-spaced interpolated points so the polyline stays visually
   continuous and downstream fitters don't see a gap.
